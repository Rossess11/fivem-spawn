# ros_spawn

This is a ESX Framework Script for a first spawn in the server interaction.
You can change the NPC coords on client.lua or can also change dialogues on script.js at the beggining
This doesn't need any dependency, but only tried with es_extended so keep taht on mind.
Here there is a description video.
